# ConocoPhillips Datathon Challenge
ConocoPhillips give a challenge for [The TAMU Datathon](https://tamudatathon.com) to make a predictor for whether an oil rig would fail given a set of sensor values (107 columns).

Here is our naive exploration of creating various classifiers to predict of a given state of sensor data would lead to a rig failure.

## Key takeaways
* Pandas is pretty neat
* Jupyter is also pretty neat
* We live in the matrix where Ax = b
* We have a long way to go to be data science masters
